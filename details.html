                        <br />
                        <p>Jonathan was a man destined for greatness but who submitted faithfully to the hand of God in his life. His life was a tapestry of bravery, sadness, friendship and tragedy. It remains an example of humility, faith, hope and love.</p>
                        <p>Throughout his life Jonathan enacts a remarkable type of faithful Israel as God’s people who enter into an everlasting covenant of kindness with the Beloved. We also see glimpses of Christ our Saviour and his work of salvation with us.</p>
